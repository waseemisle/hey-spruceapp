## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES

### Issue 1: Toast Notifications Disabled
**Problem:** Toast component was causing client/server rendering issues
**Solution:** Temporarily removed from layout
**Impact:** No visual notifications for actions
**Fix:** Alert messages can be used instead, or reinstall shadcn/ui toast properly

### Issue 2: Firebase Timestamp on Server
**Problem:** `serverTimestamp()` only works in client components
**Solution:** Already handled in current implementation
**Impact:** None - working correctly

### Issue 3: No Error Boundaries
**Problem:** App crashes on errors instead of showing error page
**Solution:** Add error.tsx files in each route
**Impact:** Poor user experience on errors

## üí° TIPS FOR CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT

The Clients and Subcontractors pages follow a clear pattern:
```tsx
1. Fetch data from Firestore
2. Display in card grid
3. Add filter tabs
4. Implement approve/reject buttons
5. Use toast for feedback
```

### 2. Copy and Modify
- Copy `clients/page.tsx` as a template
- Change the collection name
- Adjust the fields displayed
- Modify the actions

### 3. Use the Documentation
- **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** has complete code examples
- Each section has ready-to-use code
- Just copy, paste, and customize

### 4. Test Frequently
- After each feature, test the complete workflow
- Use the testing guides in README.md
- Check Firebase Console for data

## üîê FIREBASE SECURITY RULES NEEDED

**Important:** Before deploying, update Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Helper function
    function isAdmin() {
      return exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/adminUsers/$(request.auth.uid));
    }

    // Admin users
    match /adminUsers/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if isAdmin();
    }

    // Clients
    match /clients/{clientId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if isAdmin();
    }

    // Subcontractors
    match /subcontractors/{subId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow update: if isAdmin();
    }

    // Users
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
